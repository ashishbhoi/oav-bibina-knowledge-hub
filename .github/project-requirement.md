**1.2. Elevator Pitch:**  
An official, centralized web portal for students of Odisha Adarsha Vidyalaya, Bibina, providing simple, organized, and

student learning by making essential study materials easily discoverable and downloadable.

students to find the correct and most updated resources when they needed them.

**1.4. Solution Delivered:**  
The Knowledge Hub is now the single source of truth for all academic notes. It features a clean, intuitive interface
where materials are logically structured by class and subject, ensuring students can find and download what they need in
just a few clicks.

**1.5. Technical Architecture:**

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit 5 with TypeScript and modern runes-based reactivity
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with responsive design
- **Backend:** Cloudflare ecosystem (D1 database, R2 storage, Pages hosting)
- **Authentication:** JWT-based sessions with automatic redirect handling
- **File Management:** Pre-signed URLs for secure upload/download workflows
